      <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By accessing and using the DreamHomeCalc website and its associated
        tools (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service
        and all applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree with any

      <h2>2. Use of the Service</h2>
      <p>
        The Service provides cost estimation tools for construction and related
        projects for informational purposes only. These estimates are not a
        substitute for professional advice from qualified contractors,
        architects, or financial advisors. You are solely responsible for your
        use of the Service and for any decisions made based on the information
        provided.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Pro Accounts</h2>
      <p>
        Certain features, calculators, and functionalities of the Service are
        only available through the purchase of a "Pro Account."
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Term of Access:</strong> A Pro Account provides you with
          access to all premium features for a fixed term of two (2) years from
          the date of purchase. It is not a lifetime license.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Payments and Fees:</strong> The fee for a Pro Account is a
          one-time payment for the entirety of the 2-year term. All prices are
          inclusive of applicable taxes, including GST.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Refund Policy:</strong> All payments for Pro Accounts are
          final and non-refundable. Once a purchase is made, you will have
          access for the full 2-year term, and no refunds will be issued for any
          reason.
        </li>
      </ul>
