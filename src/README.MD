# Dream Home Calc â€” React + TypeScript (PWA-ready)

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
````

2. Start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes

- Replace icons in `public/icons/` with your own app icons.
- To create a Play Store AAB later, build the production site and use Bubblewrap to generate the Android project (TWA) and .aab.
- Consider integrating Workbox for a more robust service worker in production.

```

## What I created for you
- A complete, working React + TypeScript project structure
- PWA manifest + basic service-worker
- All components with the same styles and calculator logic converted to TypeScript
- PDF download, share, chart and breakdown features preserved

**Next steps for you:**
1. Download / copy these files into your `dream-home-calc` folder.
2. Run `npm install` then `npm run dev` and test.
3. Tell me if you want me to: integrate Workbox, optimize service-worker caching, add automated tests, or generate Bubblewrap commands to produce the AAB.
